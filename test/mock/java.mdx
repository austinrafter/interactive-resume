# Java

## What it is

Java is an object oriented language that allows for development of applications through a combination of
<ApiLink />s as well as data schemas through created classes.

## When I have used it

I have used Java in the creation of a student focused health application

### Projects used in

- <HealthoneLink />

## What I like about it.

Javas garbage collection makes for easy programming using Java without the
worry of memory management that is found in languages such as <CLink /> and
<CppLink />. Its object orientation allows for easily reusing attributes
within an object through inheritance which helps to minimize the code written for common objects.

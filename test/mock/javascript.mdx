# JavaScript

## What it is

A scripting language that that allows for dynamic behavioral programming for webpages. Used as basis for many web development frameworks.

## When I have used it

Iâ€™ve mostly used JavaScript through <ReactLink /> projects.

### Projects used on

- <ResumedeetsLink />
- <IntraconnectLink />
- <ChangeorderLink />
- <FoodnowLink />


## What I like about it.

Javascript's ability to take in functions as parameters for a function allows for
rapid development.

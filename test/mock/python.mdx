#Python

##What it is
Python is a general programming that is optimal for creating scripts or large data analysis.

##When I have used it
I have used Python as the controller as part of an <MvcLink /> project where the python has been used within the
<FlaskLink /> framework. It collected data passing it back and forth between the model and view as needed.

###Projects used in
- <ChangeorderLink />

##What I like about it
Python has libraries which allow for rapid analysis of large data sets making it best for implementing AI such as
large language models and image recognition into an application.

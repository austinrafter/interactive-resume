# React

## What it is

React is a javascript based web development framework where developers create javascript functions known as components and assemble them onto the rendered page in a form similar to <HtmlLink /> tags.

## When I have used it

I have the most experience using the React framework and have worked with it in most of my web development projects.

### Projects used in

- <ResumedeetsLink />
- <IntraconnectLink />
- <ChangeorderLink />
- <FoodnowLink />

## What I like about it.

React has extensive libraries of components allowing for easy development of most any function that I have had need to create. Additionally, it allows for the creation of my own components for problems that I am unable to find an outside component library for.

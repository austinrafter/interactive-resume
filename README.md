# Interactive-resume

A collection of Markdown JSX files ([mdx](https://mdxjs.com/)) go in, and a static website bundle comes out.

## How does it work?

The Markdown JSX files support a novel sub-page format like so:

>### entrypoint.mdx
```md
# Welcome to my page!

I like <FlowersLink />!
```

>### flowers.mdx
```md
# Flowers

I sure do like flowers. My favorites are roses and tulips :)
```

The `<FlowersLink />` JSX element will automatically be generated by the "framework"; it goes by filename and appends `Link`. The `<FlowersLink />` appears as `flowers` and when clicked causes the webpage to navigate to a sub-page using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

## Wiki

There's a [wiki](https://github.com/austinrafter/interactive-resume/wiki)! Additionally, Joe is cataloguing additional AI research material [here](https://github.com/candyapplecorn/speech-to-slideshow/wiki).

## Packages

* Vite - https://vitejs.dev/ - An alternative to webpack; provides a development environment with hot module reloading, and bundles all html/javascript/css/assets into a static web bundle. 
* MDX - https://mdxjs.com/ - A cool abstraction that wraps markdown with JSX component support.
* [React](http://reactjs.org/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

## Work in Progress

We are working on integrating large language model support for the documents, so that a user of the client may ask the document questions about itself. For more information, see:

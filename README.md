# Interactive Resume

__Today__:<br>
* A collection of Markdown JSX files ([mdx](https://mdxjs.com/)) go in, and a static website bundle comes out.

__WIP / "Tomorrow"__:<br>
* A collection of Markdown JSX files ([mdx](https://mdxjs.com/)) go in, and a static website bundle _âœ¨ powered by content-aware conversational artificial intelligence âœ¨_ comes out.

## How does it work?

The Markdown JSX files support a novel sub-page format like so:

>### entrypoint.mdx
```md
# Welcome to my page!

I like <FlowersLink />!
```

>### flowers.mdx
```md
# Flowers

I sure do like flowers. My favorites are roses and tulips :)
```

The `<FlowersLink />` JSX element will automatically be generated by the "framework"; it goes by filename and appends `Link`. The `<FlowersLink />` appears as `flowers` and when clicked causes the webpage to navigate to a sub-page using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

## Wiki

There's a [wiki](https://github.com/austinrafter/interactive-resume/wiki)! Additionally, Joe is cataloguing additional AI research material [here](https://github.com/candyapplecorn/speech-to-slideshow/wiki).

Here's a [cool page](https://github.com/candyapplecorn/speech-to-slideshow/wiki/Upserting-LLM-Generated-document-embeddings-in-a-storage-service-and-a-vector-database) from the wiki showing the control flow diagram for updating the knowledge base for the large language model, as well as keeping parity with existing documents across the vector database and storage solution.

## Packages

* Vite - https://vitejs.dev/ - An alternative to webpack; provides a development environment with hot module reloading, and bundles all html/javascript/css/assets into a static web bundle. 
* MDX - https://mdxjs.com/ - A cool abstraction that wraps markdown with JSX component support.
* [React](http://reactjs.org/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

## Work in Progress

We are working on integrating large language model support for the documents, so that a user of the client may ask the document questions about itself. For more information, see:

### Develoepr Notes

Joseph's gone and forked this repo. In order to push commits to a fork, he's found this as the most convenient method.
<br>Assuming two remotes,<br> 
`A`: `git@github.com:austinrafter/interactive-resume.git`<br>
`B`: `git@github.com:candyapplecorn/interactive-resume.git`

1. Push the commits up to the current remote `A`.
2. Change the current remote to `B`:<br>`git remote set-url origin git@github.com:candyapplecorn/interactive-resume.git`
3. Merge the previous remote's code into local:<br>`git merge origin git@github.com:austinrafter/interactive-resume.git main`<br>(_not 100% sure this command is right_)
4. Push the local up to remote `B`

And that's how you can keep a fork up to date with another branch! Don't forget to switch the remote back to the original branch when you're done ðŸ˜Š

__List remotes with their URL's:__ `git remote -v`

```bash
candy/interactive-resume        git@github.com:candyapplecorn/interactive-resume.git (fetch)
candy/interactive-resume        git@github.com:candyapplecorn/interactive-resume.git (push)
origin  git@github.com:austinrafter/interactive-resume.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:austinrafter/interactive-resume.git (push)
```

This is handy because it shows which remote is currently set as the default remote.
